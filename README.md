# Js WebGl Image Viewer with "Mostly bug free" mouse controls

I was looking for similar functionality for a project I'm building and couldn't find one that doesn't require external dependencies, so I built one

You can view this project in a desktop browser here: https://ademi.github.io/webgl_js_image_viewer/



Then open `http://localhost:8000` to view the example.
